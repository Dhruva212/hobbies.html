		<h2>Running</h2>
		<img src="" width="300px">
		<p> I love the tension you get right before a race starts and I love the pain you feel after a hard workout. Running makes me be more focused and it helps stay relaxed.</p>
		<h3>Watching TV</h3>
		<img src "" width "300px">
		<p> Watching TV after a long day is the best thing in the world. <br> My favorite shows are Big Bang Theory, Grey's Anantomy, and The Flash. I usually watch TV as soon as I get home from school to clear my mind from all the chaos. It's a great way to de-stress your mind after a long day of work. </p>
		<h4>Reading</h4>
		<img src=""width="300px">
		<p> Reading is the best way to get lost in your thoughts. It not only is good for you on an academic level, however it causes you think more creative. It makes your thoughts grow and help you interpret images/ concepts better. It is peaceful yet wild at the same time.</p>
